      <description>Howdy! I&amp;rsquo;m Miguel! I&amp;rsquo;m a student at Plano East Senior High School studying computer science. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in how technology shapes our daily lives from a very young age, which led me to pursue a career where I could explore and learn new things.
My Journey I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. From the day I was born, I was fascinated by anything with an on-and-off switch.</description>
